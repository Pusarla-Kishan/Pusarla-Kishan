    This is Problem-2.1 from Exercise 4.2
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Represent the following situations mathematically:
(i) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and
the product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find
out how many marbles they had to start with.
\end{enumerate}
\solution:\\Required quadratic equation is :
let the number of marbles John had be x.\\
Then the number of marbles Jivanti had = 45 – x \\
The number of marbles left with John, when he lost 5 marbles = x – 5\\
The number of marbles left with Jivanti, when she lost 5 marbles = 45 -x – 5= 40 – x\\
Given that product of number of marbles = 124\\
\begin{align}
(x-5)(40-x) &=124\\
40x-x^2-200+5x &= 124\\
-x^2+45x-200 &= 124\\
-x^2+45x-200 &= 124 \\
-x^2+45x-324 &= 0\\
x^2-45x+324 &= 0\\
x^2-36x-9x+324 &= 0\\
x(x-36)-9(x-36)&=0\\
(x-36)(x-9)&=0\\
x=36 or x=9
\end{align}
while,john had 36 marbles.Then jivanti will have 9 marbles.
