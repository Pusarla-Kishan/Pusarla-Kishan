    This is Problem-2.1 from Exercise 4.2
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Represent the following situations mathematically:
(i) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and
the product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find
out how many marbles they had to start with.\\
\solution:\\Required quadratic equation is :
let the number of marbles John had be x.\\
Then the number of marbles Jivanti had = 45 – x (Why?).\\
The number of marbles left with John, when he lost 5 marbles = x – 5\\
The number of marbles left with Jivanti, when she lost 5 marbles = 45 -x – 5= 40 – x\\
${(x-5)(40-x)}$\\
= ${40x-x^2-200+5x}$\\
= ${-x^2+45x-200}$\\
 ${-x2+45x-200 = 124}$ (Given that product = 124)\\
 ${-x^2+45x-324=0}$\\
 ${x^2-45x+324=0}$


\end{enumerate}
